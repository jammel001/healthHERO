      <h3>About this assistant</h3>
      <p>This assistant (HealthChero) provides informational health guidance based on symptoms entered by users. It is built by <strong>Bara'u Magaji</strong> and team. The system uses a trained model and third-party medical references to suggest possible conditions and general advice.</p>

      <h3>How to use</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Describe symptoms clearly in the chat or use the Quick Form (comma-separated).</li>
        <li>Confirm suggestions when asked (the assistant may propose canonical symptom names).</li>
        <li>Provide optional patient details when requested (age/sex) to improve guidance.</li>
        <li>After the assessment you may download a PDF summary.</li>
      </ol>

        <li><strong>Urgent symptoms:</strong> If you experience chest pain, trouble breathing, severe bleeding, sudden weakness, loss of consciousness, or severe allergic reactions — seek emergency care immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Children, pregnant people, elderly:</strong> If the patient is a child, pregnant, or older than 65, seek direct clinical care when symptoms are concerning.</li>
